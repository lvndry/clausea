## Why Separate Services?

### 1. **Separation of Concerns** 🎯

**FastAPI Service:**

- Purpose: Serve API requests from frontend
- Users: End users (customers)
- Availability: High (24/7)
- Traffic: User-driven, can be high

**Streamlit Service:**

- Purpose: Admin dashboard for management
- Users: Internal team/admins
- Availability: Can have downtime
- Traffic: Low, occasional use

### 2. **Independent Scaling** 📈

**FastAPI:**

- Scale based on user traffic
- May need multiple instances for load
- Optimize for request throughput
- Memory: Lower (256MB-512MB)

**Streamlit:**

- Scale based on admin usage
- Usually single instance is enough
- Optimize for UI rendering
- Memory: Higher (512MB-1GB)

**Example:**

- User traffic spikes → Scale up FastAPI only
- No admin activity → Scale down Streamlit to save costs

### 3. **Resource Optimization** 💰

**FastAPI Service:**

- Lower memory footprint
- Optimized for async requests
- Minimal dependencies for API
- Can run on smaller instances

**Streamlit Service:**

- Higher memory for UI rendering
- More dependencies (UI libraries)
- Can be scaled down when idle
- Can use sleep mode

**Cost Impact:**

- Separate services: Pay for what you use
- Combined service: Always pay for max resources

### 4. **Independent Deployment** 🚀

**FastAPI:**

- Deploy API updates without affecting Streamlit
- Can deploy multiple times per day
- Zero-downtime deployments
- A/B testing capabilities

**Streamlit:**

- Deploy dashboard updates independently
- Less frequent deployments
- Can test new features without affecting API
- Rollback doesn't affect API

**Example Scenario:**

- API needs urgent bug fix → Deploy immediately
- Streamlit has new feature → Deploy separately
- No interference between deployments

### 5. **Better Isolation & Fault Tolerance** 🛡️

**If FastAPI Crashes:**

- Streamlit still works (can debug API issues)
- Admin can still access dashboard
- Can check logs, restart API from Streamlit

**If Streamlit Crashes:**

- API keeps serving users (no impact)
- Users don't notice
- Can debug Streamlit separately

**If Both in One Service:**

- One crash takes down both
- Harder to debug which component failed
- Users affected by admin tool issues

### 6. **Security & Access Control** 🔒

**FastAPI:**

- Public-facing (needs strong security)
- API authentication (JWT tokens)
- Rate limiting
- CORS restrictions
- DDoS protection

**Streamlit:**

- Admin-only access
- Can restrict to VPN/internal network
- Different authentication (password-based)
- Can be behind firewall
- Less attack surface

**Security Benefits:**

- Separate attack surfaces
- If Streamlit compromised, API is isolated
- Can restrict Streamlit access more strictly

### 7. **Monitoring & Observability** 📊

**FastAPI:**

- Monitor API response times
- Track request rates
- Error rates
- User-facing metrics

**Streamlit:**

- Monitor admin usage
- Track dashboard load times
- Different alert thresholds
- Less critical monitoring

**Benefits:**

- Separate metrics dashboards
- Different alerting rules
- Easier to identify issues
- Better performance insights

### 8. **Development Workflow** 👨‍💻

**FastAPI:**

- API developers work on API
- Frontend team integrates with API
- API-first development

**Streamlit:**

- Admin tools team works on dashboard
- Independent development cycles
- Can test without affecting API

## When Single Service Makes Sense

**Only consider single service if:**

- ❌ Very small project (MVP/prototype)
- ❌ Limited resources (free tier only)
- ❌ Admin dashboard rarely used
- ❌ Both services always needed together

**For production:** Always use separate services.

## Railway Configuration

### FastAPI Service

```toml
# railway.toml (API service — see docs/RAILWAY.md for worker/streamlit overrides)
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
# Do NOT set startCommand — use Dockerfile CMD with ${PORT:-8000}
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
```

### Streamlit Service

```toml
# railway.toml (or Railway dashboard settings)
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
startCommand = "uv run streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.headless=true"
healthcheckPath = "/_stcore/health"  # Streamlit health endpoint
healthcheckTimeout = 100

# Resource limits (can be different)
[resources]
memory = 1024  # MB (more for UI)
cpu = 0.5      # vCPU
```

## Cost Comparison

### Separate Services (Recommended)

**FastAPI:**

- Always on: ~$10-15/month
- Handles user traffic

**Streamlit:**

- Can scale down when idle: ~$5-10/month
- Or use sleep mode (Railway Pro): ~$2-5/month

**Total: ~$12-25/month**

### Single Service

- Always on with max resources: ~$20-30/month
- Can't optimize per service
- Wastes resources when Streamlit idle

**Verdict:** Separate services are more cost-effective and flexible.

## Migration Path

If you currently have them combined:

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy Streamlit as separate service
2. **Phase 2**: Test both services work independently
3. **Phase 3**: Update documentation and runbooks
4. **Phase 4**: Monitor and optimize resource allocation

## Conclusion

**✅ Separate Services = Best Practice**

For production, always deploy FastAPI and Streamlit as separate services. The benefits far outweigh the small additional complexity.

**Key Benefits:**

- Better scalability
- Independent deployment
- Cost optimization
- Better fault tolerance
- Improved security
- Easier monitoring
